👋 Hey, I’m Marq

💻 Software & ML Engineering Student @ UC Davis
🚀 Passionate about building tools at the intersection of machine learning, software, and real-world impact.
🌱 Currently: working on projects in web dev, ML apps, and Arduino prototyping.

🔨 Projects I’ve Built

Embergency: Wildfire + cell-tower overlay app for first responders (React/Next.js, Google Maps API, Breezometer, OpenCellID).

Trashform: AI-powered recycling recognition app (Python, ML, custom logo & branding).

Toes Down: Multiplayer “Heads Up”–style web app with custom study decks (React/Next.js, gyroscope integration).

Adaptive Aerodynamics: Arduino-based car prototype simulating downforce braking (AvenueE program project).

🌟 Involvement

📚 UC Davis AvenueE Program Advisor (PA) → helping transfer students transition into engineering.

⚡ Google Developers Student Club (GDSC) → secondary lead, ML & web projects.

🧮 Physics/Math/CS Club (PMCS) → past research on elliptical universe modeling & solar system simulations in Python.

🤝 NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) member & CAAA Leadership Scholar.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, C++, JavaScript (React/Next.js), R, LaTeX

Frameworks/Tools: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Arduino, Git/GitHub

Other: UI/UX design, technical writing, stats modeling, project leadership

🎯 Goals

Short-term: grow as a developer & ML engineer through projects, hackathons, and internships.

Long-term: apply machine learning for defense, safety, and large-scale problem solving.
